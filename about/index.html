    <h2>How the Story began</h2>
    <p>
      I was started my journey into web developing in late 2010. In that time I was doing a lot of things not connected with html/css coding, such as SEO and web design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon I was involved in learning coding tuts and start following conferences and trainings alongside of Ukraine. I met interesting people in Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Kiev, Zaporozhie, Simferopol and Donetsk. This was one of the main sources to learn and progress with my new skills. And of course, a tons of practice and <a href="/portfolio/">projects</a> which I was contributed to.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
      Make web and mobile more user-friendly and usable, find new ways to enhance user experience. I'm always looking forward for new technologies and searching for ways to make best quality solutions in web and mobile developing.
