title:  "Colombo – Nallathanniya. Sri Lanka, day 2"
description: "It was one of the best and remarkable days in the trip. We moved out of Colombo 
              and all day drive through the mountains to the base of Adam's Peak (Sri Pada), 
              seeing beautiful views and Tea Estates around."

Finally, we get car and out from Colombo. The road was so interesting and curvy! That is keep me 
concentrated all the time. What is more curious is the quality of road coating – the main roads is in
good condition. Much better than in Ukraine!
