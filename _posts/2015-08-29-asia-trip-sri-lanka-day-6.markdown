description: "Another one well-known sight of Sri Lanka – Sigiriya Rock. It was a beautiful view 
              from the top. At the bottom monkeys did fight training session. In the evening 
              we was on the East Coast of Sri Lanka and saw the sea first time since arrive."

We spent a great time at Sigiriya and then went to the East and first time saw the sea since we land 
in Sri Lanka.
