Finally we found a good hotel and it was in Kandy. The Kandy Holiday Resort is located at the 
mountain in neighbour with jungle forest and it has a beautiful view. In the morning I saw monkeys 
sitting at my window and owner asked us do not open the windows at night because small snakes can 
jump from trees to the room.

The rest of the day we drive through Dambulla and saw Rock Temple and lately in the evening we was at
Anuradhapura.
