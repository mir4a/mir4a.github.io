## ADT

ADT is an Abstract Data Type

> class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations 

**Lists** should have the following properties and methods:

- **listSize** representing number of elements in the list;
- **append/prepend/insert** methods, for adding new element;
- **shift/pop/splice** method, removing element;
- **clear** for making list empty;
- **find** helper method for searching position of the item in the list;
- **getElement** to print particular element from its position.

Yesterday I'll try to implement Lists Class and find out, why the author didn't use the built-in 
property `length` and implement it's from scratch
