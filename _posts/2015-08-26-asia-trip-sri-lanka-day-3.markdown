title:  "Sri Pada â€“ Nuwara Eliya. Sri Lanka, day 3"
description: "This night we slept for few hour after long road and early in the morning 
              we started to climb to Adam's Peak (Sri Pada). The road to the top was exhausting 
              but it worth it we saw a beautiful picture on sunrise! On half way 
              to Nuwara Eliya we met macaques and feed sour watermelon and diet cookies to them."

Sri Pada or Adam's Peak is well-known Sri Lankan sights. But that day was some religious holiday and 
people comes from each corner of the island. Sadly, but we didn't reach to the top of Sri Pada, we 
almost done it and stuck on stairs which is full of people.

The rest of the day we rode on mountain roads seing beautiful views.
