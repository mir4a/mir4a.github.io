description: "Night in old colonial building help us to refresh our energy and we had a great time 
              at Victoria's park and museum. The road to Kandy was just amazing in quality 
              and it's beautiful landscape views around."

After a good rest we went to the North. But first we spent few hours in Victoria's park and museum.
The road became more attractive with a lot of waterfalls around and a lot of tea factories. 
And we visit one of them, the Mackwoods, and taste a good black tea.
