The plan was sleep one night in Negombo near airport after late approach and go to Colombo next morning.
But flight after all day walking in Dubai was so exhausting that we slept until midday and went to 
Colombo too late. And we did not get in time to the rental company and had to stay in Colombo to the 
next morning.
