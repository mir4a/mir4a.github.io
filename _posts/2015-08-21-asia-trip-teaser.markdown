This March I traveled to three countries. It's been a very intensive and saturated trip to Dubai, 
Sri Lanka and Kuala Lumpur. 20 days in exhausting movement and fascianting pictures! Almost every day
 it was a new place to sleep, eat and see. At the current moment I've sorted out and cutted at least 
 96Gb of videos. And here is the teaser of this series:

<div class="video_responsive"> 
  <iframe width="100%"

          frameborder="0" 
          allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

For the next few weeks I'll publish new videos each day. It would be small clips with max duration of
7-8 minutes — the most concentraded memories of the trip. Few words about some core concept in my 
videos:

- It should be strictly into chronological sequence;
- It should not being longer than 10 minutes, the best duration is about 5 minutes;
- It doesn't contain any background music (except trailer), all sounds should be real;

As the result I'm expecting that each viewer can see the other culture as it is and make it's own 
conclusions. So, make a joy and I hope it will inspire you to travel more, because it's… It's great!
