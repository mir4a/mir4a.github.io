Second day in Dubai was impressive with its very long distances, very tall buildings 
and continuous malls. Sadly but that day was sand storm and the view from the world's tallest building 
was not so impressive (actually it was).

Thanks for watching!

The next video will be tomorrow in the morning. Some spoiler here: Negombo met us in lovely guest house 
owned by Rasika Fernandes and his wife but Colombo was not friendly for us and we have to stay there 
for one night and it was a nightmare.
