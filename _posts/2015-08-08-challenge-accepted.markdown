It's time to dig into algorithms! But seriously, I don't have a formal degree in Computer Science
and my willing to became a good front-end developer pushed me into this decision. Because algorithms
and data structures is essential part in software development. Nowadays modern single page 
applications can have a lot of business logic on front-end. Fetching data via api, sorting, 
generating trees, drawing charts and editing photos â€” all of this and much more can be done at 
browsers with javascript. That being said, if I want to be a good front-ender I must have this 
knowledge.

The other reason is I want to know how back-end works inside. I have few personal projects which is 
in early development stage and some of them is building with NodeJS and should have usable api and 
scalable db.
 
### Rules

1. Learn algorithms at least 1 hour per day, at least 6 days per week until August 31th.
2. Make a post to this blog with short conclusion and thoughts.
3. Find solution to current assignment until August 31th.


### Assignment

> Find solution for slicing photos from scanned image. On `stdin` you'll have image in 
format `pnm` with different photos placed above defined chroma key background. On `stout` you should 
have few files with `jpeg` format and packed input source file.


Ok, let's just started and see what will happen.
